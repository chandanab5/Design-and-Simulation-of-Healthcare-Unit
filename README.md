# Design-and-Simulation-of-Healthcare-Unit

The most important aspect of any country is its healthcare system, but many healthcare providers struggle to provide patients with practical and innovative services. The current emergency clinics are outfitted with cutting-edge technology to save as many lives as possible given the situation. Automation contributes to improved patient health outcomes by assisting technological breakthroughs. Automation can also notify medical staff of known drug interactions and contraindications by querying a database. 

In this study, we used IoT technologies and Cisco Packet Tracer software to construct a smart hospital system. The system incorporates IoT devices, guarded medical wards, automated electrical appliances, and fire alarm systems. The Cisco Packet Tracer's characteristics can be used to simulate a smart hospital. Results from the simulation demonstrate that smart objects may successfully connect to the hospital server, raising the possibility of application in the real world.
